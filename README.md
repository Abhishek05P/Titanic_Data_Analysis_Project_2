# üö¢ Titanic_Data_Analysis_Project_2

### **Project Objective** 
**Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook and Power BI**

* Performed detailed EDA on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights into passenger demographics, survival rates, and feature relationships.
* Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset by **handling missing values**, encoding categorical variables, and removing irrelevant features.
* Visualized key patterns using **bar plots**, **histograms**, heatmaps, and **boxplots** to analyze the impact of features like age, gender, class, and fare on survival.
* An interactive Power BI dashboard powered with **DAX**, **KPI cards**, **Slicers.**
* Derived actionable insights, such as higher survival rates among women and first-class passengers, to support potential predictive modeling.
